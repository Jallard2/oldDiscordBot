# discordBotSamples

## Overview
This is an older discord bot that I created a while ago that does economy commands, moderation, as well as plays some games with the users. This bot can be interacted with by using the prefix and does not support slash commands.

## Status
This bot has not been updated in over a year now and with the updates to the discord.py library updating to version 2.0, this bot no longer functions as it is supposed to. The majority of the commands still work but some of the smaller pieces may have some unintended consequences.
